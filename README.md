**GenAI-Powered Research Paper Q&A App**
Welcome to the GenAI-Powered Research Paper Q&A App! This application leverages cutting-edge GenAI technology for contextual question-answering from research papers, powered by **Groq**, **LangChain**, and **Streamlit**.
**Overview**
This app allows users to ingest research papers (in PDF format), parse and embed their content, and then query the documents for context-based answers. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, combining vector-based search with **Groq's Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-70b** model for fast and accurate results.

Key technologies used:

* **Groq** LPU-powered model inference

* **LangChain** for document processing and retrieval

* **Ollama** Embeddings for semantic vectorization

* **FAISS** for efficient vector-based similarity search

* **Streamlit** for a user-friendly, interactive interface
